### Reset your database:

```bash
npx prisma migrate reset
```

This command will drop the existing database, recreate it, and apply all migrations from the `prisma/migrations` directory. It will also run any seed scripts if you have them configured.

### Generate New Prisma Migrations:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name init_identity
```

This command will create a new migration based on the changes in your `schema.prisma` file. The `--name` flag allows you to give a descriptive name to your migration, which can help you keep track of changes over time.

### Introspect the database:

If you made manual changes to the database that you want to keep, you can:

```bash
npx prisma introspect
```

This command will update your `schema.prisma` file to reflect the current state of your database.

### Generate a new migration to include the introspected changes in your migration history:

```bash
npx prisma migrate dev --name introspected_change
```

This command will create a new migration that includes the changes from the introspection step. This way, your migration history will be up to date with the current state of your database.
